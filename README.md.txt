#  JSONPlaceholder API Testing Project

This project demonstrates manual API testing using the public fake API [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

It is designed as part of my QA portfolio to show understanding of RESTful APIs, HTTP methods, response validation, and test case documentation.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Perform manual API testing of common endpoints
- Document test cases in a clear and structured format
- Practice request/response validation using a REST client (e.g. Postman)
